Font Installation Instructions
============================

To complete the branding setup, you need to:

1. Copy the MontserratAlt1-Regular.otf font file to this directory (src/assets/fonts/)
2. The font is already configured in the CSS (src/index.css) and ready to use
3. The login and register pages have been updated to use the new branding styles

Font Usage:
- The font is applied to brand elements using CSS classes like .brand-nexus, .brand-reactor-minds
- "Reactor Minds" text now uses larger sizing and "Minds" is colored orange (#ff6b35)
- Both desktop and mobile versions have been updated

Current Font Configuration:
- Font Family: 'MontserratAlt1-Regular'
- Font Weight: 400 (Regular)
- Font Format: OpenType (.otf)
- Path: './assets/fonts/MontserratAlt1-Regular.otf'

Note: Place the MontserratAlt1-Regular.otf file in this directory to activate the custom font.
